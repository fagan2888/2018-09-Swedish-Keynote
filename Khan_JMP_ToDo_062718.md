# ToDo list for Khan_JMP -- 062718

Things that need to be added to the model:
1. Add permanent shocks to income as a Markov process.
  * `Status: `
2. Adjust discounting to include a positive probability of death.
  * `Status: `
3. Add unemployment.
    * This will be done using an extremely low and persistent value for the permanent shock.
       * NO -- there is an extremely low value for the TRANSITORY shock; the permanent hit is 10%
    * Roughly a hit of 10% to permanent income due to unemployment.
    * ***Confirm with Prof. Carroll if there is anything else that needs to be factored in when adding unemployment.***
  * `Status: `

Calibration and experiment

1. Make sure the model can match pre-crisis default rates under lose lending standards.

2. Hit the model with unexpected unemployment shocks.

3. Run a counterfactual with tighter lending standards and hit the economy with unexpected unemployment shocks.

4. Compare (2) and (3) using the following metrics:
    * Default rate
    * Consumption response
    * Wealth distribution -- ***Confirm with Prof. Carroll.***

* `Status:`
