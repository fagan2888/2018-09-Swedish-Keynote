# Notes -- Hedlund, Karahan, Mitman, and Ozkan (2016)
## Monetary Policy, Heterogeneity, and the Housing Channel
#

* Study the role of housing and mortgage debt in the transmission and effectiveness of MP.
* Housing channel:
  * Decline in interest rate $\implies$ Increase in demand for housing by reducing the cost of borrowing and alleviating credit constraints.
* Liquidity channel:
  * Increase in demand $\implies$ increased prices $\implies$ faster sale
* Cash-flow channel:
  * Decline in interest rate $\implies$ refinancing
* Redistribution channel:
  * Redistribution between net debtors and net lenders
* Income channel:
  * Response as a result of changes in labor demand

Mechanism
* Monetary contraction $\implies$ decline in house prices $\implies$ decline in housing liquidity $\implies$ elevated foreclosure risk $\implies$ tighter credit $\implies$ further price decline
  * Following a monetary contraction, 20% of the drop in aggregate consumption is due to the decline in house prices.
* Contractionary shocks yield a larger response of all variables than expansionary shocks.
* Monetary policy more effective in stimulating the economy in high-LTV environment.
  * High-LTV environment implies a wider distribution of MPC, with more HHs having high MPCs.

**Model:**
* Builds on HANK
* Infinitely lived households
* Time is discrete
* Uninsurable labor income risk
* This model also features endogenous liquidity of the housing market and house prices.
* Long-term mortgages, with refinancing allowed
* Price rigidities due to monopolistically competitive producers -- Rotemberg costs
* Directed search and block-recursive structure
