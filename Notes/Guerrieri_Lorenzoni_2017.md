## Credit Crises, Precautionary Savings and the Liquidity Trap
#

* Effect of credit crunch on consumer spending in a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-market model.
* After an unexpected permanent tightening in consumers' borrowing capacity,
  * constrained consumers are forced to repay their debt,
  * unconstrained consumers increase their precautionary savings.
  * This depresses interest rates (particularly in the short-run) and generates output drop, even with flexible prices.
  * Output drop larger with sticky prices, if ZLB prevents interest rates from adjusting downwards.
  * With durable goods in the model, HHs take larger debt positions and the output response can be larger.
