# Literature Review

**From Berger et al. (2018)**\
Many models introduce complicated asset structures of this form but then simplify in some important dimensions relative to our model. For example, Ganong and Noel (2016) and Gorea and Midrigan (2017) have no house price shocks, which are the heart of our article, and the former does not model housing choices. Beraja et al. (2017) assume an exogenous fixed housing size as do Campbell and Cocco (2015) except when defaulting. Greenwald (2016) works with a representative borrower model and so abstracts from heterogeneity in income shocks, MPCs and housing values. Kaplan et al. (2016) work with a general equilibrium model with richer mortgages than our own but then limit houses to one of six sizes for computational tractability, which limits the strength of substitution effects. Wong (2016) also features an extremely rich quantitative environment but does not allow for separate refinancing and moving decisions and computational tractability requires working with a two-state income process and small number of house price values, limiting the MPC heterogeneity which we show is important for house price effects on consumption.

**From Khan (2018)**\
Campbell and Cocco (2013) study the effect of differences in LTV and loan-to-income on the foreclosure decision in an environment with a rich structure of exogenous shocks. However, they do not consider the implications of household heterogeneity for contract selection. Household characteristics, like wealth, have implications for not just contract selection, but also the pool of risky borrowers, and mortgage pricing. Guren et al. (2018) construct a housing model with long-term mortgages and an option to default; however, the utility cost from default in their model is set so high that the households never actually default.
