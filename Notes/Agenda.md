***Heterogeneity, Housing, and Macroeconomic Policy: An Agenda***

This talk will propose a roadmap for the construction of a new generation of models that can deliver quantitatively believable answers to two central questions:
* How do changes in interest rates affect the housing market (and thereby aggregate demand) in normal times?
* How can we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of alternative macroprudential policies in a world where we hope never to get data that can tell us which macroprudential policies are failures?

My topic will basically be to lay out a roadmap for future research on housing and heterogeneity, the topic of the conference. My agenda will be strongly tilted toward where I think the theoretical tools need to go, and so I will need your help in getting a comprehensive idea of where they are now.


***Q1: How do changes in interest rates affect the housing market (and thereby aggregate demand) in normal times?***

***Q2: How can we quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of alternative macroprudential policies in a world where we hope never to get data that can tell us which macroprudential policies are failures?***

***T1: Where are the theoretical tools now?***
* What do we mean by theoretical tools?
  * Model features
    * Discrete choices over housing tenure, mortgage balance, and consumption
    * Discrete choice over housing tenure, continuous choice over mortgage balance and consumption
  * Computational tools
    * Root-finding
    * VFI

***T2: Where do they need to be?***
