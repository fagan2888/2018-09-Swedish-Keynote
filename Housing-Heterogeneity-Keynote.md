# Alternate History ('History 2.0')
<!-- Not as exciting as "what if Hitler had won," but similar idea -->

<!-- In this alternate reality, ... -->
## Suppose from 2001 we'd had '2030 Tools:' <!-- I will elaborate in part 2 -->
### _Panel_ data at the household level:
   * Integrated HH balance sheets (registry, or [Mint.com](https://mint.com), e.g.)
   * _With_ Expectations ('What will stock/housing prices do?') <!-- Michigan does this now -->
   * _With_ Explanations ('_Why_'?) <!-- Almost nobody does this now; Michigan a little bit -->

### Models that can handle:
<!--   * Not only balance sheets ...
      * Already pretty close using conventional ideas
         * Risk preference, discount rates, income shocks
-->         
   * Expectations and explanations heterogeneity
      * Many competing theories right now
         * Nagel, Shleifer et al, 'k-level thinking,' ... <!-- SAK: -->
      * Let's run with _heterogeneous_ extrapolative expectations
         * Shiller looks back 150 years
         * Some people look back 3 years
         * Heterogeneous "Memory," for short
      * Implies (I think; and will assume) ...

<!--       
  * Result:
      * Dot-Com Bubble a Rockefeller moment:
          * know it's a bubble when shoeshine boy is giving stock tips
-->

## ... Toy Theory Of Bubbles

*  Some genuine good news arrives
   * Fundamental value of asset is higher
*  Spread of beliefs is like a disease   
   * Susceptible to infection:
       * People with funds ...
       * ... and short 'memory'
       * ... and high risk tolerance
    * Infected:
      * Buy the asset (or more of it)
       <!-- US example is familiar but themes are universal -->
<!--
*   Purpose?
    * Illustrate generic interplay between theory, data
    * NOT to claim this is the _right_ theory
-->
<!--
Guess: Nagel model with heterogeneous memory may generate something like this
-->

## Prehistory
<!-- Can't avoid talking about this because it set the stage -->

Mid-90's Productivity Acceleration
  * Greenspan's "New Economy" Heresy (~1996)
  * ERP marks "Consensus": <!-- Achieved faster than for 1970s slowdown -->
     * [Economic Report of the President (2001)](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/2001.pdf)
<!--        * "The New Trend In Productivity" (p. 26) -->
<!-- CBO: Budget surpluses as far as the eye can see -->

<!--      * Stock market peaked March 2010 -- just before ERP conceded -->
Consequence: Boom in asset prices
  * Stock Market (1994-2000)
  * [_Also ~30 percent rise in house prices_](https://github.com/llorracc/Figures/blob/2018-09-Swedish-Keynote/UpwardSlope2.jpg)

<!--
## Prehistory 2.0

*  Data allowed us to identify people with _ex ante_
      * Low Memory (young; less education)
      * Low risk aversion
      * Surprisingly fast income growth
*   _We see_ these people _differentially_
      * Had biggest change in expectations
      * Had biggest change in actions
*   _They tell us_ they
      * Invested because $\mathbb{E}[\Delta p] \uparrow$
      * (cf Hall 2000)
-->

<!-- SAK: add Blinder:After the Music Stopped to references -->

<!--
## Prehistoric Theories

* Rationally Exuberant Expectations
   * Hall (2000) AEA Ely Lecture (I think -- SAK find it)
      * Companies rapidly creating "intangible capital"
* Irrational Exuberance (Shiller)
   * No Usable Theory of the _Right_ model
-->   
<!---        
    * Accounting frauds:
      * "Off balance sheet" entities (Enron, others)
      * "Crisis of Confidence" in financial markets -->
<!--- Find a figure showing data, maybe from Shiller, with expectations of stock returns in some period before and after the crash of the dot-com bubble in 2001 --->

## The Boom: History 1.0 - Facts

2000-01: <!-- SAK: find facts about mildness of housing decline in 2000-01 recession -->
   * Housing is _not_ the cycle <!-- Ed Leamer notwithstanding (SAK: Leamer Jackson Hole paper) -->

2001-05: Chinese external saving unleashed (WTO)
* $\Rightarrow$ Interest rates lowest since Great Depression
* Bernanke  "global savings glut ('GSG')" (2005) <!-- SAK: add to bibfile -->

2002-06:
  * Continuing $\uparrow$ in availability of credit
     * Subprime _and_ prime
     * For primary residences _and_ nonprimary
      <!--      * Real and nominal -->
      <!--      * Greenspan "conundrum" speech (2004?) -->
      <!---        * Sidenote: Theory says the "conundrum" was why 30 year rates and overnight rates were so highly correlated _before_ 2004 --->


## The Boom: History 1.0 - Interpretation

2002:
   * First claims housing bubble is inflating
      * Krugman; the _Economist_; scattered others <!-- SAK find link to Krugman column, put in bibfile -->
      <!-- SAK: Find graphs of consumer house price expectations; Mian and Sufi (2018)? -->

2004:
   * Shiller: 'Might be a bubble' <!-- SAK: Shiller discussed a paper of mine at the Fed where he said this; see if you can find him saying it publicly in 2004; put in bibfile -->
   * Gramlich: 'Something funny going on around here' <!-- SAK: Find citation for Gramlich's warnings -->
        * 'Financial innovation'

## The Boom: History 1.0 - Interpretation

2005:
   * Himmelberg, Mayer and Sinai (JEP): <!-- SAK: put in bibfile and papers -->
      * 'Not a bubble - improved fundamentals'
         * "New Economy" is now consensus
         * Low $R$ (from GSG and Fed) <!-- Fed was worried about deflation (!) -->
         * 'financial innovation' <!-- * In the Volcker sense -->

<!-- Now everybody _understands_ the toy theory above -->
## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006)
* _Prereq_ for bubble: improved fundamentals
* 2002-2003: Lots of people in "susceptible" pool
   * $\Delta_{\bullet}~ p^{h}_{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+\bullet}]$ is high: "momentum" <!-- SAK: Use data from [Michigan surveys](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/charts.php) to show $\Delta_{1} p^{h}_{t} vs ... \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$ for period over which both are available) -->
   * "New Economy" + Bush upper-income tax cuts
      * They have some money
      * Michigan survey: Pessimistic about stock market (after bubble)



## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006)

Increasing 'infection'  <!-- (citekey for Pizzesi and Schneider 'marginal' investors) -->
* _We see_ people's expectations changing _heterogenously_
   * _Among those_ with $\uparrow$ in $\mathbb{E}[\Delta p^{h}]$
     * Biggest increase among _ex ante_ low memory types
        * _We ask them why_ and they _say_, basically, "momentum"
   * _Marginal_ demand driven by low-memory optimists <!-- Citation for Mian and Sufi vs Adelino etc -->
      1. Primary residence buyers: buy more expensive houses
      2. More and more buying "as an investment" and not residence
    * Data _are_ the plural of anecdotes
         * Hairdressers, 'shoeshine boys' becoming 'flippers'
         <!-- SAK: Find quote -- Rockefeller? -- about how you know its a bubble when shoeshine boy gives you stock tips -->
<!--       * TV shows do not lie -->
<!-- Models vs data
   * Krugman _et al_ may have a point
   -->

## Boom to Bust: History 2.0 (2007-08)

* 2030-type _Theory+Data tell us_ people default when:
   * Underwater
   * Negative income shock
   * pessimistic $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$
* 2030 theory tells us <!-- $\Delta p^{h}_{t-1} \Rightarrow \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p_{t+1}^{h}]$ -->
   * If at $t$, _inflow_ declines ($\downarrow$ _marginal_ demand)
      * then $\Delta p^{h}_{t+1} < \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$

## Boom to Bust: History 2.0 (2007-08)
* In 2007, _expansion_ of credit stops <!-- Fed SLOOS shows this -->
*
   * _Low memory types_ extrapolate quickly:
       * $\Delta p^{h}_{t+1} < \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$
         * $\Rightarrow \mathbb{E}_{t+1}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+2}] < \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+2}]$
       * Low memory optimists become pessimists
         * "infection": pessimist demand dries up

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* $\Rightarrow$ Macropru regulators know how to do _micro_ 'stress tests' <!--        * Prudence: $\mathbb{E}[u^{\prime}]$ -->
    * At date $t$, see balance sheets and $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+\bullet}]$
    * Simulate alternate _future_ histories:
       * Fundamental shocks
       * Uncertainty shocks
       * ...

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* Result: Ever-increasing worry from 2002-2006
    * Low-equity HH's + 'double triggers' $\Rightarrow$ defaults
       * More and more low-equity HH's (financial innovation!)
       * "stress test" says very susceptible to increase in unemployment
    * Theory: When "susceptible" exhausted, "momentum" reverses
<!--       * All risk-tolerant low-memory hairdressers _already_ flippers -- Manafort too -->
* Micro stress tests reveal major fragility

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
Consequence? History 2.0 differs from 1.0
   * Macropru policy targeting _marginal_ people
      * Likeliest defaulters:
         * High LTV, High DSTI
         * People with more uncertain (variable) income
      * Fuel-On-the-Fire _marginal_ real estate investors
         * Charge them for the pecuniary externality they impose
   * Bubble avoided!

## The Bust: History 1.0

![](Figures/Retail-Sales-Collapse.jpg "Retail Sales Collapse")

## The Bust: History 1.0

Competing stories:
  * $\downarrow$ in believed level of permanent income <!-- SAK: Find Cochrane reference saying this -->
  * $\uparrow$ labor income uncertainty

# Part 2: Agenda

## Modeling (near term priorities)

### Incorporate real estate investing in HH problem
   * Integrated with "primary housing" choices
   * Governed by same expectations, explanations

### Focus of models (and analysis thereof):
   * _tell us what questions to ask on surveys_
   * e.g., Kaplan, Mitman, Violante would imply
      * Get Expectations, explanations
      * Are Explanations about Fundamentals?
         * 'I think $R$ is permanently lower'
   * _Whose_ expectations to focus on
      * Forever-renters?  Not important
      * People with marginal decisions?  Critical

### Dynamics (not just steady states) <!-- very hard; got to try -->
   * _Especially_ for the marginal players
   * Sluggishness in $p^{h}$ _and behavior_ comes from:
      * Search frictions (Garriga and Hedlund, e.g.)
      * Information frictions
         * Everybody knows everything instantly: won't work
   * Very hard

## Modeling Expectations and explanations (Desiderata)
Simplicity: Ideals
   * Same model for _Everybody_
      * Difference in parameter like "memory"
   * Behavioral foundations strongly supported by evidence
      * "Other people are like me" <!-- Find a reference of evidence of this -->
      * "Representativeness Heuristic" <!-- SAK: Kahneman book "Thinking fast and slow" into bibfile -->
      * Fading Memory <!-- SAK: Nagel and Malmendier refs into bibfile -->
      * ...

## Modeling Expectations and explanations (Desiderata)
Reproducibility
   * Modular
   * Open-source
   * Common framework across researchers
      * [Econ-ARK](http://econ-ark.org)!

# Expectations Data
Sampling frame: Data source with rich info on balance sheets
* U.S.: Mint.com, Credit Panels
* Scandinavia: registry
* Elsewhere: Internet panels

### Proposal: Abolish Consumer Expenditure Surveys
Replace them with Consumer Expectations Surveys <!-- Same acronym, so not too hard -->
* Get expenditures from admin data (Mint.com, registries)
* Use precious survey time asking:
   * expectations
   * explanations
   * actions
   * _whatever else models identify as important_

### Proposal: Abolish Consumer Expenditure Surveys

* Oversample potential _marginal_ decisionmakers
   * e.g. intensive surveys of new homebuyers
   * 'Are you a flipper?'

# Conclusion
* Might take more than 12 years
* We'll get there!
