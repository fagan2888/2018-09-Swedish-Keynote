# Alternate History ('History 2.0')
<!-- Not as exciting as "what if Hitler had won," but same idea -->

<!-- In this alternate reality, ... -->
## Suppose from 1995 we'd had '2030 Tools:'
### _Panel_ data at the household level:
   * Integrated HH balance sheets (registry, or Mint, e.g.)
   * Expectations ('What will stock/housing prices do?')
   * Explanations ('_Why_'?)

### Models that can handle _all_ kinds of heterogeneity:
   * Not only balance sheets ...
      * Already pretty close using conventional ideas
         * Risk preference, discount rates, income shocks
   * ... but _also_ expectations and explanations heterogeneity
      * Many competing theories right now
         * Nagel, Shleifer et al, 'k-level thinking'
         * Generically: Extrapolative expectations
      * Let's run with one:
         * _Everybody_ has extrapolative expectations
         * Shiller looks back 150 years
         * Some people look back 3 years
         * "Memory," for short

<!--       
  * Result:
      * Dot-Com Bubble a Rockefeller moment:
          * know it's a bubble when shoeshine boy is giving stock tips
-->

<!-- SAK: Add cites for Charles MacKay (1841) - Kindleberger book - Minsky -->
## Toy Theory Of Bubbles

*  Some genuine good news arrives
   * Fundamental value of asset is higher
*  Spread of beliefs is like a disease   
   * Susceptible to infection:
       * People with funds ...
       * ... and short 'memory'
       * ... and high risk tolerance
    * Infected:
      * Buy the asset (or more of it)
       <!-- US example is familiar but themes are universal -->
<!--
*   Purpose?
    * Illustrate generic interplay between theory, data
    * NOT to claim this is the _right_ theory
-->
<!--
Guess: Nagel model with heterogeneous memory may generate something like this
-->

## Prehistory
<!-- Can't avoid talking about this because it set the stage -->

Mid-90's Productivity Acceleration
  * Greenspan's "New Economy" Heresy (~1996)
  * ERP marks "Consensus": <!-- Achieved faster than for 1970s slowdown -->
     * [Economic Report of the President (2001)](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/2001.pdf)
<!--        * "The New Trend In Productivity" (p. 26) -->
<!-- CBO: Budget surpluses as far as the eye can see -->

Consequence: Boom in asset prices
  * Stock Market (1994-2001) <!--      * Peaked about when ERP conceded -->
  * _Also x percent rise in house prices_ <!-- SAK: find x for both Case-Shiller and FHFA -->

<!--
## Prehistory 2.0

*  Data allowed us to identify people with _ex ante_
      * Low Memory (young; less education)
      * Low risk aversion
      * Surprisingly fast income growth
*   _We see_ these people _differentially_
      * Had biggest change in expectations
      * Had biggest change in actions
*   _They tell us_ they
      * Invested because $\mathbb{E}[\Delta p] \uparrow$
      * (cf Hall 2000)
-->

<!-- Blinder:After the Music Stopped -->

<!--
## Prehistoric Theories

* Rationally Exuberant Expectations
   * Hall (2000) AEA Ely Lecture
      * Companies rapidly creating "intangible capital"
* Irrational Exuberance (Shiller)
   * No Usable Theory of the _Right_ model
-->   
<!---        
    * Accounting frauds:
      * "Off balance sheet" entities (Enron, others)
      * "Crisis of Confidence" in financial markets -->
<!--- Find a figure showing data, maybe from Shiller, with expectations of stock returns in some period before and after the crash of the dot-com bubble in 2001 --->

## The Boom: History 1.0

2000-01:
   * Housing is _not_ the cycle

2001: China Joins WTO
   * Chinese external saving unleashed
      * $\Rightarrow$ Interest rates lowest since Great Depression

2002:
   * First claims housing bubble is inflating
      * Krugman; the _Economist_; scattered others

2004:
   * Shiller: 'Might be a bubble'
   * Gramlich: 'Something funny going on around here'
        * 'Financial innovation'

## The Boom: History 1.0, 2003-2006

2003-2006:
* Large $\uparrow$ in availability of credit
   * Subprime _and_ prime
   * For primary residences _and_ nonprimary
   * Bernanke notices "global savings glut" (2005)      
<!--      * Real and nominal -->
<!--      * Greenspan "conundrum" speech (2004?) -->
<!--         * "Something funny going on around here" -->
<!---        * Sidenote: Theory says the "conundrum" was why 30 year rates and overnight rates were so highly correlated _before_ 2004 --->

2006:
   * Mayer and Sinai (JEP):
      * 'Not a bubble - there was a shock to fundamentals'
         * By 2001, "New Economy" is now consensus
         * Low $R$ (from GSG and FRB)
         * 'financial innovation' <!-- * In the Volcker sense -->

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006)
* Prereq for bubble: shock to fundamentals
* 2002-2003: Lots of people in "susceptible" pool
   * $\mathbb{E}[\Delta p^{h}]$ is high: "momentum" <!-- Also, cf stock market fraud/Enron -->a
   * "New Economy" still lingers: They have some money

* 2003-2006: Increasing 'infection'  <!-- (cf Pizzesi and Schneider 'marginal' investors) -->
    * _We see_ individual people's expectations changing
       * _We ask them why_ and they _say_ "momentum"
    * People _say they are_ investing in houses not stocks
         * _Because_ $\mathbb{E}[\Delta p_{h} \uparrow]$    
         * Buying bigger houses
         * _margin_: more and more buying "as an investment"
    * Data _are_ the plural of anecdotes
         * Hairdressers, shoeshine boys becoming 'flippers'
<!--       * TV shows do not lie -->
<!-- Models vs data
   * Krugman _et al_ may have a point
   -->

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* _Theory+Data tell us_:
    * People default when:
       * Underwater
       * Negative income shock
       * pessimistic $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$
    * $\Delta p^{h}_{t-1} \Rightarrow \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p_{t+1}^{h}]$
       * If at $t$, _inflow_ declines (fewer _marginal investors_)
       * Then $\Delta p^{h}_{t+1} < \mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p^{h}_{t+1}]$
       * "momentum" reverses

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* $\Rightarrow$ Macropru authorities know how to do _micro_ 'stress tests' <!--        * Prudence: $\mathbb{E}[u^{\prime}]$ -->
    * At date $t$, take balance sheets, $\mathbb{E}_{t}[\Delta p_{h}]$
    * Simulate alternate _future_ histories:
       * Fundamental shocks
       * Expectations shocks

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* Result: Ever-increasing worry from 2002-2006
    * Low-equity HH's + 'double triggers' $\Rightarrow$ defaults
       * More and more low-equity HH's
    * _marginal_ demand from "investors" can vanish overnight
    * Know: when "susceptible" pool exhausted, "momentum" can reverse
       * All risk-tolerant low-memory hairdressers already flippers

## The Boom: History 2.0 (2002-2006, Macropru edition)
* Consequence? History 2.0 differs from 1.0
   * Increasing macropru intervention targeting _marginals_
   * _Especially_ targeting likeliest defaulters:
      * High LTV, High DSTI, _and nonprimary_
      * People with more uncertain (variable) income
   * Bubble avoided!

# Part 2: Agenda
## Expectations Data
Sampling frame: Data source with rich info on balance sheets
* U.S.: Mint.com, Credit Panels
* Scandinavia: registry
* Elsewhere: Internet panels

### Proposal: Abolish Consumer Expenditure Surveys
Replace them with Consumer Expectations Surveys
* Get expenditures from admin data (Mint.com etc)
* Use precious survey time asking:
   * expectations
   * explanations
   * actions

## Models (near term)

Sluggishness in $p^{h}$ comes from:
   * Search frictions
   * Imperfect information

Incorporate "speculative demand"
   * Integrated with "primary housing" choices
   * Governed by same expectations, Explanations
   * Match theory to data
      * Not just (or mainly) steady-state
      * Key: Dynamics of _marginal_ investors

## Modeling Expectations and explanations (Desiderata)
Desiderata:
* Congruence between:
   * Empirical expectations/Explanations
   * Model-implied expectations/Explanations
* Dependence on/connection to balance sheets
   * _Whose_ expectations move is crucial
      * Forever-renters?  Not important
      * People with marginal decisions?  Critical


## Modeling Expectations and explanations (Desiderata)
Simplicity
   * Ideal: Same model for _Everybody_
      * Difference in parameter like "memory"
   * Behavioral foundations strongly supported by evidence
      * "Other people are like me"
      * "Representativeness Heuristic"
      * Fading Memory
      * ...

## Modeling Expectations and explanations (Desiderata)
Reproducibility
   * Modular
   * Open-source
   * Common framework across researchers
      * Econ-ARK!

# Conclusion
* Might take more than 12 years
* We'll get there!
